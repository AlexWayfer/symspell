This is a straight port of SymSpell from C# to Ruby. No cleanup has been attempted at this stage. I may tidy up the code at some point. In fact I might well turn it into a gem. Stay tuned.

Original source with inline comments and README is here: https://github.com/wolfgarbe/symspell.

The Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm reduces the complexity of edit candidate generation and dictionary lookup for a given Damerau-Levenshtein distance.
